# Project Introduction

ape-frame, where "ape" denotes "çŒ¿" (a playful moniker for programmers in Chinese), aligns perfectly with our designation as programmers! I envision this framework as the go-to development framework for us programmers in the future.

I've always wanted to create a lightweight rapid development framework suited for small and medium-sized enterprises, encompassing common scenarios encountered in routine business development, ensuring it's ready to use right out of the box. Users can select components based on their individual needs, embracing a component-based development approach.

For instance, if a user requires Redis, they would select the Redis component; if WebSocket is needed, they would incorporate the WebSocket component. Users won't need to develop anything on their own, but simply follow the component rules for utilization.

Additionally, numerous examples are provided for some classic tools and design pattern code. Whenever users encounter these business scenarios, they can use them directly.

The project is developed using a Maven structure, encapsulating a multitude of modules, each decoupled from the others, catering to the everyday development needs of the users.

I hope everyone could lend a hand by giving a Star; your Star is the greatest support for me. Continuous updates are in progress, with microservices version being updated!
